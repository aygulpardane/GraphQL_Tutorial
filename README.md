# GraphQL_Tutorial

To build our homepage grid feature, we used a schema-first approach, meaning we considered data needs from the client's perspective before even starting to code.

We defined our schema and used Apollo Server to build a basic GraphQL endpoint that provides mocked responses.

We then used the Apollo Sandbox Explorer to interactively build and test queries against our local GraphQL server.

Finally, we developed the client side of our Catstronauts app. We used React, Apollo Client, and the useQuery hook to perform a query on our GraphQL server and to display our tracks in a nice grid card layout.
